### INFO
This is a CS 412 Class. We were tasked to implement a Client-Server application that
allows for a user to login and play two types of games with a bet attached.

One being Coin Toss with 1:1 odds. And the other being Dice Roll with a 20:1 odds.


### Run the project
If you would like to run the project and try it out for your self. There is a MainServer
and MainClient.

Run the server first to allow for the server to initialize, client will not boot if
server is not started. 

As well as the server needs the SQLite JDBC and SLF4J drivers to work.
